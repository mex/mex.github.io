mex.io
======

Codebase for [mex.io](http://mex.io). It is a simply design with a name on top and four squares containing Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, and LinkedIn logos beneath.

There have been added some responsiveness, but it might contain a few bugs, let me know, if you find any.

You can use this as you like, though the logos has to be used according to the specifications from each owner.
